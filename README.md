Group members: Quinn Trate, Zachary Newman, Jagger Gilleland
Sponsors: Prateek Grover MD PhD MHA
Faculty advisor: Hien Nguyen, Ph.D.
Technologies you intend to use: Python (Django Framework), and SQL
Problem statement: This is to try and solve the complicated process of following the steps after a lower limb amputation. This is needed as there is a lot of fall-off during
the path to obtain a prosthesis. This also includes tracking for the prosthesis to assess better the needs of a patient and what prosthesis will work best for them.
